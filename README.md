# CraftedCircuitry's Peaceful Player Trader for Minecraft 1.16+
A Datapack for Minecraft that trades Minecraft Diamonds into non-Peaceful mode Items and Functionalities. 

This is an old Minecraft Datapack I regularly use on my singleplayer Minecraft worlds. This adds vanilla functionality that you normally don't see in Peaceful mode.

Note: Not Updated to the latest Minecraft Version
