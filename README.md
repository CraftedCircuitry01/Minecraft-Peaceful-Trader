# Minecraft-Peaceful-Trader
A Datapack for Minecraft that trades Minecraft Diamonds into non-Peaceful mode Items and Functionalities
[Note: Works for 1.16+, Not Updated to the latest Minecraft Version]
***
This is an old Minecraft Datapack I regularly use on my singleplayer Minecraft worlds. This adds vanilla functionality that you normally don't see in Peaceful mode.
